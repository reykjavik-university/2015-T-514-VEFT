## What is docker?
>Docker is an open platform for building, shipping and running distributed applications. It gives programmers, development teams and operations engineers the common toolbox they need to take advantage of the distributed and networked nature of modern applications.

>Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.



### Build
>Docker allows you to compose your application from microservices, without worrying about inconsistencies between development and production environments, and without locking into any platform or language.

### Ship
>Docker lets you design the entire cycle of application development, testing and distribution, and manage it with a consistent user interface.

### Run
>Docker offers you the ability to deploy scalable services, securely and reliably, on a wide variety of platforms.
