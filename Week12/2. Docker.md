# Docker #

In simple terms Docker can be described as lightweight virtual machines.
Docker uses features from the Linux kernel (originally called LXC or Linux containers). With these features you can run a virtual machine but combine it with the machine working under. So you are not using a comlete operating system but sharing the kernel with the guest system.
LXC makes new address space for your processes, new userspace, so you are in a isolated box in this system but not booting up a whole system from scratch.

So in general Docker builds on top of facilities provided by the Linux kernel and does therefor not require or include a seperate operating system. Instead it uses recource isolation and seperate namespaces to isolate the application's view of the operating system. <sup>1</sup>


Installing Docker on your computer is very simple. On Windows and Mac you can just go to Docker's [website](http://docs.docker.com/) and click get started. After the download all you need to do is go through a simple installation process and you should be all set with Docker.
On Linux you can follow these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/)
